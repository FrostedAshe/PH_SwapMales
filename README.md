# PH_SwapMales
A Plugin for PlayHome that allows swapping the male characters in a scene with a keyboard shortcut.  
For example, if there are two males and one female in a scene (3P), pressing the Numpad Multiply ( * ) key will swap the appearances of the two males.
For scenes with more than two males (4P and 5P) the males are cycled.
